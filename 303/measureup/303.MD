# Hybrid Authenticaiton
* Password stored in on premises and support smart card authentication
  * Federation with Active directory federation Services (AD FS)
[choose right hybrid authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/choose-ad-authn)

* Password hash synchroniation 
  * Premimum features of Azure AD
    * Identity protection
    * Azure Domain services
  * Do not use this for User level active directory security policies requrired scenario.
   

* Password Pass through authentication
  * Software agent runs on one or more on-premises servers
  * User account states, password polices, sign-in hours enforced on on-premises.
  * Require 2 on premises agents for redundency.

* Federation authentication
  * Separate trusted authentication
  * Smart card based authentication
  * Thirdparty multi factor authentication.

* If you want to disaster recovery or leaked credential report , then add password hash to other methods.
* Azure AD does not support natively these
  * Sign-in using smartcards or certificates.
  * Sign-in using on-premises MFA Server.
  * Sign-in using third-party authentication solution.
  * Multi-site on-premises authentication solution

* Azure AD Identity Protection requires Password Hash Sync regardless of which sign-in method you choose, to provide the Users with leaked credentials report.

* Azure AD Identity Protection require Azure AD Premium P2 licenses.

* Smart lockout
  * Smart lockout helps lock out bad actors that try to guess your users' passwords or use brute-force methods to get in. Smart lockout can recognize sign-ins that come from valid users and treat them differently than ones of attackers and other unknown sources. Attackers get locked out, while your users continue to access their accounts and be productive
  * Available for password-hash sync and Pass through (but not for federated)

# Azure Migrate

## Hyper-V
* Host
  * You can select up to 10 VMs at once for replication. If you want to migrate more machines, replicate in groups of 10.
  * The Hyper-V host can be standalone or deployed in a cluster.
Azure Migrate replication software (Hyper-V Replication provider) is installed on the Hyper-V hosts.
  * You need administrator permissions on the Hyper-V host.
  * Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, or Windows Server 2012 R2 with latest updates. Note that Server core installation of these operating systems is also supported
  * .NET Framework 4.7 or later
  * Outbound connections on HTTPS port 443 to send VM replication data.

* Hyper-V VM
  * All Windows and Linux operating systems that are supported by Azure.
  * For VMs running Windows Server 2003, you need to install Hyper-V Integration Services before migration.
  * Some VMs might require changes so that they can run in Azure.
  * Disk size - up to 2 TB OS disk, 4 TB for the data disks.
  * A maximum of 16 disks per VM.
  * Encrypted disks/volumes	Not supported for migration.
  * RDM/passthrough disks	Not supported for migration.
  * Shared disk	VMs using shared disks aren't supported for migration.
  * NFS	NFS volumes mounted as volumes on the VMs won't be replicated.
  * Azure Site Recovery	You can't replicate using Azure Migrate Server Migration if the VM is enabled for replication with Azure Site Recovery.
  * Ports	Outbound connections on HTTPS port 443 to send VM replication data.

* Azure VM
  * Bitlocker not supported.

# Front Door

* Incoming match
  * Protocol/Host/Path is a potential match set.
    * HTTP Protocols (HTTP/HTTPS)
    * Hosts (for example, www.foo.com, *.bar.com)
      * Look for any routing with an exact match on the host.
      * If no exact frontend hosts match, reject the request and send a 400 Bad Request error.
    * Paths (for example, /*, /users/*, /file.gif)
      * Look for any routing rule with an exact match on the Path.
      * If no exact match Paths, look for routing rules with a wildcard Path that matches.
      * If no routing rules are found with a matching Path, then reject the request and return a 400: Bad Request error HTTP response.
