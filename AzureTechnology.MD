## Virtual Networks
* When you create an Azure virtual machine (VM), you must create a virtual network (VNet) or use an existing VNet. You also need to decide how your VMs are intended to be accessed on the VNet
* Azure Virtual Network service enables you to securely connect Azure resources to each other with virtual networks (VNets). A VNet is a representation of your own network in the cloud. A VNet is a logical isolation of the Azure cloud dedicated to your subscription. You can also connect VNets to your on-premises network. The following picture shows some of the capabilities of the Azure Virtual Network service:
